Once upon a time there was a two year old girl who could program the VCR before she could read, or pronounce her “r” sounds.

Her parents didn’t think much of it at first, by the time they figured it out, there was no going back.

By age, 10, this generally quiet girl had been unrelenting in her campaigning for a home computer, and despite her father’s insistence they were pointless and a waste of money (circa 1987) an apple IIGS was purchased.

While her sister played with dolls, she spent her time parked in front of that computer, the boot up floppy removed, so she could experiment with coding.
Freshman year in college, she spend every spare moment in the CS lap, noodling around, creating websites and messing with the settings on the computers to leave weird little Easter eggs for the other students to discover.
After graduation, she moved to London, and worked for Lloyds of London in a small qualitative and quantitative risk assessment department; coding both the website as well as the demo version of the software for the sales department.
Upon moving back to the states- her career took a turn towards engineering physical consumer goods, everything from infant car seats to novelty goods to handbags, while teaching herself auto cad on the side for fun.
But her first passion never left, and now, she she is back..</p>
